# NAICS Code Summary Statistics Data Set

This repository contains scripts, files, and information on high-level data about NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) codes for people to use for whatever they see fit. Use this repo to quickly put in the standard names of NAICS code into your customer data set, or maybe even use it to try and clean up a dataset that doesn't have quite the same NAICS codes as the ones that are listed on the [NAICS code site](https://www.naics.com).
